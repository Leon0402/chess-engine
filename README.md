This repo contains a didactic introduction to the implementation of a chess engine. It has the following features: 

* Minimax algorithm
* Alpha-Beta-Pruning (& NegaMax implementation)
* Iterative Deepening
* Transposition Tables
* Simple piece based evaluation
* Simple piece squared evaluation (SimplifiedEvaluation)
* Quiescence Search
* Principal Variation Search
* Opening book
* Endgame books
* Match Functionality to play against it as a human
* Performance Tests with Bratko-Kopec Tests
* Peformance Tests with matches between implemented engines and stockfish

The whole project is realized with Jupyter Notebook. It is implemented in multiple sections that can be found in `src/sections`. It is recommend to read them in chronological order. For more information regarding the development setup, see `CONTRIBUTING.adoc`.
