    "## Research Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this work is the development of a fully functional chess engine. One of the main parts, the implementation of the chess rules as well as the graphical representation of the chess game, will be provided by the `python-chess` library. Thus, this work concentrates on the actual implementation of artificial intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chess Engines that can outperform even the best human players, such as the latest `Stockfish` engine, usually use a combination of symbolic AI and machine learning to achieve the best results. Additionally, they also use high-performance computers. \n",
    "The objective is by no means here to compete with these engines, there will be no machine learning involved nor will the developed chess engine use a high-performance PC. Instead, the focus is on exploring various symbolic AI techniques and using chess as a demonstration for those. {cite}`stockfishGithub`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the evaluation of chess positions, the (Simple Evaluation Function by Tomasz Michniewski)[https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function] will be used. In combination with the alpha-beta-pruning algorithm and transposition tables, it forms the foundation of the chess engine. To achieve acceptable performance, the engine will be enhanced by using a quiescence search. \n",
    "Additional Enhancements such as the inclusion of chess books for openings and end games will be examined. "

    "# Project Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "One great advantage of python is the number of already built-in features such as native JSON or YAML support. Nevertheless, in almost all python projects there is some need to install additional third-party libraries. Most of these are available in the python package index (PyPi) and can easily be installed with the tool `pip`. \n",
    "These dependencies might require a specific platform, python version or even other dependencies in some specific versions. Newer versions of the libraries might not always be compatible with older versions. In a collaborative project, it is therefore essential to specify the dependencies and their version. Pip has a built-in way to do this by writing all installed dependencies and their version to a requirements.txt file with the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. Another developer can then install exactly these dependencies with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with this approach is that all dependencies will be installed globally and therefore might conflict with other packages. Additionally, `requirements.txt` will also contain all globally installed dependencies. To avoid these problems it is a common approach to create a virtual environment for each project. Some popular tools for creating and managing virtual environments are `virtualenv` and `pyenv`, both work well with `pip` and `requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this setup works in general it has the problem of being rather complex and error-prone. There are multiple tools needed and possibly documentation on how to use these in the project. Additionally, the workflow is not enforced by the tools, there is no need to name the file `requirements.txt` nor to even keep it up to date and therefore error-prone. Additional requirements such as building or publishing the package, although not relevant for this project, need additional tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with these issues there exist several tools operating on a higher level and combining the single tools. Some of the more popular tools are `Pipenv` and `Poetry`. Both are suitable for this project, but `Poetry` was chosen as it's already known by the authors. With poetry metadata and dependencies are listed in a `poetry.toml` file. The command `poetry install` will read the file and write a resolution of the dependencies and their version constraints to a `poetry.lock` file. Then it will create a new virtual environment or use a previously created one and install the resolved dependencies. If the `poetry.lock` file already exists the already resolved dependencies will be installed directly. To run a tool inside the virtual environment, use the `poetry run` command. For more detailed information on poetry consult the (documentation)[https://python-poetry.org/docs/]. \n",
    "\n",
    "By requirement, the chess engine will be built with jupyter notebook. To execute code inside a jupyter notebook a jupyter python kernel is needed. The kernel is a dependency of the project and will be installed in the virtual environment by poetry. Additionally, it might be necessary to generate a kernel description with `poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name poetryenv --display-name \"Python (poetry env)\"` so the kernel can be selected in jupyter."
