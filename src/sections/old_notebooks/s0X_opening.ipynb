    "The first improved version of `RandomEngine` \n",
    "is the `OpeningRandomEngine`,\n",
    "which will have access to an opening book. \n",
    "(Polyglot)[http://hgm.nubati.net/book_format.html] is a widespread book format for openings.\n",
    "Because a lot of open-source opening books \n",
    "in the `polyglot` format \n",
    "can be found on the internet\n",
    "and because it is supported by the `python-chess` library,\n",
    "it is used in this example. \n",
    "The repository contains some sample `polyglot` opening books.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OpeningRandomEngine` \n",
    "inherits from `RandomEngine` \n",
    "and overwrites the `play` method. \n",
    "In the new `play` method, \n",
    "the engine first searches for moves \n",
    "in the opening book \n",
    "using the helper method `getOpeningMoves` \n",
    "and,\n",
    "if no move is found,\n",
    "falls back to the implementation of `RandomEngine`. \n",
    "The method `getOpeningMoves` \n",
    "takes the current chessboard as a parameter \n",
    "and returns a list of `ScoredMove` objects. \n",
    "It uses the `chess.polyglot.MemoryMappedReader` class \n",
    "of the `python-chess` library\n",
    "to open a `polyglot` opening book. \n",
    "The `find_all` method of the reader \n",
    "is used to search the opening book \n",
    "and create a list of scored moves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, \n",
    "however, \n",
    "that the score of the move is defined by the author of the opening book and usually depends on how often and sucessfull it was played by profiecient players. \n",
    "In some rare cases, following the book, leads quickly into a draw by fivefold repition, therefore a minimum weight has been defined."
