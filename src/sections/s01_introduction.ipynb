    "## Research Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this work is the development of a fully functional chess engine. One of the main parts, the implementation of the chess rules as well as the graphical representation of the chess game, will be provided by the `python-chess` library. Thus, this work concentrates on the actual implementation of artificial intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chess Engines that can outperform even the best human players, such as the latest `Stockfish` engine, usually use a combination of symbolic AI and machine learning to achieve the best results. Additionally, they also use high-performance computers. \n",
    "The objective is by no means here to compete with these engines, there will be no machine learning involved nor will the developed chess engine use a high-performance PC. Instead, the focus is on exploring various symbolic AI techniques and using chess as a demonstration for those. {cite}`stockfishGithub`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the evaluation of chess positions, the (Simple Evaluation Function by Tomasz Michniewski)[https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function] will be used. In combination with the alpha-beta-pruning algorithm and transposition tables, it forms the foundation of the chess engine. To achieve acceptable performance, the engine will be enhanced by using a quiescence search. \n",
    "Additional Enhancements such as the inclusion of chess books for openings and end games will be examined. "
