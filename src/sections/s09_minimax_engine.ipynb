    "Until now, a move was evaluated according to the value the heuristic gives to the resulting position. Thus, the chess engine lacks the foresight to find tactical combinations or a mate in several moves.\n",
    "With the help of a search algorithm all future positions can be found, which are created after playing a certain number of moves. The below [game tree](https://www.yosenspace.com/posts/computer-science-game-trees.html) shows how the resulting positions in the game `TicTacToe` can be represented as a search tree. The root node is the initial position, while the leaf nodes contain the final positions that will be evaluated. A special feature of TicTacToe is that the leaf nodes are terminal states. In chess, on the other hand, the search usually has to be stopped at a certain depth, because the number of states is simply too large even for modern computers. The leaf nodes are therefore not necessarily terminal states and are thus evaluated with the already known heuristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "![TicTacToe GameTree](./images/tictactoe-gametree.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "By limiting the search depth, however, the original problem is only partially solved. As before, it can happen that the considered final position ends, for example, in the middle of a slugfest and is correspondingly wrongly estimated. It also often leads to the fact that the engine tries to delay a foreseeable problem by giving chess etc. until it is no longer visible due to the search depth. \n",
    "This is called the [horizon effect](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Horizon_Effect), which can have a very strong impact on the engine's playing strength and is discussed accordingly in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, however, some search algorithms are presented, starting with the `MiniMax algorithm`. For this purpose, first a class `MiniMaxEngine` is defined,\n",
    "which inherits from `Engine`,\n",
    "but many parts will be familiar from the `EvaluationEngine`.\n",
    "It expects an instance of an `Evaluator` to be passed at construction time as does the `EvaluationEngine`.\n",
    "Additionally an integer `look_ahead_depth` is expected to specify the depth of the search tree."

    "In each recursive pass, the method returns the value of the current node from the perspective of white.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the `Evaluators` method `evaluate` checks whether the current position is a terminal state. If this is the case, the evaluation of this from the perspective of white is returned accordingly. \n",
    "Otherwise, it is checked whether the maximum search depth has been reached and it is therefore a leaf node. In this case the `heuristic` method of the `Evaluator` is used and the value from the perspective of white is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither of the termination conditions is true, the recursive part of the method is executed. For each possible move the new position is generated and recursively calculated with `_value`. In total, a list of values is generated for each child node in the search tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the question remains how the node itself is evaluated based on the evaluations of the child nodes. The key idea of the `MiniMax algorithm` is that there is a minimizing and a maximizing player. When it is White's turn, he tries to maximize the valuation for his move. Accordingly, in this case the maximum value of the child nodes is returned. If, on the other hand, it is black's turn, he tries to minimize the valuation for his move. Therefore, the minimum value of the child nodes is returned. \n",
    "Overall, the algorithm assumes that both players want to win and play the best move for themselves. The respective position is thus evaluated as the future position that would be reached if both players played optimally."
